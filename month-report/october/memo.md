# **_Self-Learning_**

## **JavaScript**

- Finished but skip the last chapter of the biggest project (8h) of this course.
  - Last project's purpose is:
    - Getting familiar with all skills.
    - Get familiar with building a complete website codes architecture and programming pattern.
    - Establish more practical experience in user-interactive flowchart plainning.
  - In Emily's use, the last two purposes are less important, so I choose to skip and continue learning other courses.

## **ELK**

- The popularity on Udemy is relatively low, there is not a perfect teacher for each aspect, so I bought two courses:

  - The first course has more presentations and very little practical work, so I only read the section on how the core database works.
  - The second course is almost all practical work:
    - Elasticsearch API
    - Logstash
    - Beats
    - Kibana, but not much content, suggest to find out by ourselves.

- You need to pay a fee to open the encryption and permission service, along with this part of the course instruction is also relatively few, usually with a presentation to take over.

- I use it to create metadata for my study notes.
  - BTW, It can aggregate some statistical indicators or graphs without taking much time.

## **NodeJS**

- Reasons to study:

## **PowerShell**

- Reason to study:

- Almost done the course.

# **_Emily_**

## **Self-Research**

- Did four skills to help me create notes.
- Ask questions and solve problems on the emily forum.

## **Plateform**

- ELK Solution Abandoned.
  - Emily log has few properties and not enough complexity to make it meaningful for users to have full Kibana usage.
  - In order to use encryption and privileged services the copyright costs are too high and the alternatives are likely to be too resource intensive or too complex.
- define graphes/indicators to each permisstion for odoo. (not yet started)
